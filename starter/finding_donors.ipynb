    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `fnlwgt` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: `capital-gain` and `capital-loss`. \n",

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of 0 is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above 0 to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `capital-gain` or `capital-loss` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`:\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    \n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            \n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  \n",
    "| 1 |  C  |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  \n",
    "\n",
    "We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`:\n",
    "\n",
    "|| someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "|0| 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "|1| 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "|2| 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `income` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as 0 and 1, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `features_log_minmax_transform` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than $50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than $50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than $50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than $50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{\\text{precision} \\cdot \\text{recall}}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot \\text{precision} \\right) + \\text{recall}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the $F_{0.5}$ score (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most $50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than $50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than $50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than $50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives (words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives (all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classification), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}} {\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Positives}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall (sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives (words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}} {\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Negatives}}$$\n",

    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions, like in our case, for example, if we had 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the remaining 98 weren't, accuracy is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam (including the 2 that were spam, but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam (all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score and the weighted average (harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean when dealing with ratios)."

In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

    "* When we have a model that always predicts 1 (i.e., the individual makes more than 50k) then our model will have no True Negatives (TN) or False Negatives (FN) as we are not making any negative (0 value) predictions. Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision (True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value 1 that should have 0 becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "## Random Forest\n",
    "Real-world application: Random forest classifiers are frequently used by risk analysts in the finance industry to develop credit risk models to calculate the probability of a borrower defaulting on a loan. They are also used to detect fraudulent transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "- It is designed for classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "- It works well with large datasets and can handle both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "- It is less prone to overfitting than single decision trees because it builds multiple trees from random subsets of data and features.\n",
    "- It naturally handles non-linear relationships and outliers\n",
    "Weaknesses:\n",
    "- It can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive, especially with a large number of trees or very large datasets.\n",
    "- It is a \"black box\" model, meaning its predictions are hard to interpret and explain to stakeholders, unlike a single decision tree or logistic regression.\n",
    "**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suitability for census data: \n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests is a good candidate because census data typically involves a large number of features and non-linear interactions between them. Its ability to handle complex data and prevent overfitting makes it a strong choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradient Boosting \n",
    "Real-world application: Gradient boosting models are important for supporting investment decisions, such as portfolio optimization, and predicting stock price movements or credit risks based on historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "- It often achieves higher predictive accuracy than random forests.\n",
    "- It sequentially builds trees, with each new tree minimizing the errors (residuals) of the previous ones, effectively creating a strong learner from an ensemble of weak learners.\n",
    "- Techniques like regularization and early stopping help to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses:\n",
    "- It is more sensitive to noisy data and outliers compared to random forests.\n",
    "- It can be more prone to overfitting if hyperparameters are not tuned carefully.\n",
    "- Training can be slower, particularly on very large datasets, because trees are built sequentially, not in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suitability for census data: \n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting is well-suited for census data because it can capture subtle patterns and achieves top performance in many complex machine learning competitions. Given the potentially complex relationships within demographic data, gradient boosting may have better accuracy if the data is clean and sufficient time is spent on tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logistic Regression\n",
    "Real-world application: \n",
    "In healthcare, logistic regression is a staple for clinical risk prediction. For example, researchers use it to predict the likelihood of patients developing a certain disease (like diabetes) based on lab tests and medical history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "- It is easy to implement, interpret, and train efficiently.\n",
    "- It outputs well-calibrated probabilities along with classification results.\n",
    "- It performs well when the dataset's features are linearly separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses:\n",
    "- It assumes linearity between the independent variables.\n",
    "- It struggles with non-linear problems and fails to capture complex relationships naturally.\n",
    "- Its performance can degrade if important non-relevant features are included.\n",
    "- It can underperform more complex algorithms like random forests on data with complex, non-linear boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suitability for census data: \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good candidate when interpretability is a primary goal, allowing researchers to easily understand which demographic factors are the strongest predictors of an outcome.  Logistic regression is a standard and commonly used statistical method for binary classification problems with demographic data, such as predicting whether an individual's income falls above or below a certain threshold.\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",

    "**TLDR: Gradient boosting is well suited for census data; careful tuning will yield very good results; and moderate training time but prediction times comparable to logistic regression make it the best alternative.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting is well-suited for census data because it can capture subtle patterns and achieves top performance in many complex machine learning competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the primary objective is achieving the highest possible accuracy and F-score, the Gradient Boosting Classifier or the Random Forest Classifier offer the most potential.  Both models achieve significantly higher performance metrics on the testing set compared to Logistic Regression (around 0.8-0.85 vs. 0.6-0.65).  They show some gap between training scores (near 1.0) and testing scores, which suggests overfitting.  Careful hyperparameter tuning (such as adjusting tree depth, learning rate, or regularization parameters) could potentially close that gap and improve generalization.  Given that both ensemble methods scale performance with more training data, further refinement is likely to push performance metrics higher than is possible with the Logistic Regression model.  **Of Note: Gradient Boosting classifier performance continued to trend better with more data and is likely a more promising option.**\n",

    "However, logistic regression outperformed the other models in terms of speed both in training and prediction times. Gradient Boosting Classifier took the longest to train but performed comparably to logistic regression in prediction times.  Conversely, random forest classifier had poor training and prediction times making it a less desirable option."

    "**Answer:** \n",
    "Gradient Boosting works by building a powerful, highly accurate \"super-learner\" out of a large collection of  simple, weak learners (basic decision trees). The key is the sequential training process.  The model starts with a simple initial guess, and then trains subsequent weak advisors. It identifies where the team of advisors is still missing the mark and trains the next tree to step in and correct that specific error, similar to how one might refine several drafts of a research paper. This iterative process allows the model to incrementally and efficiently reduce its overall errors until it achieves a high level of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it is time to predict if a new individual is likely to donate, all the simple decision trees that were trained in sequence work together. Each tree contributes a small adjustment to the prediction started by the very first tree. The final output is the cumulative sum of every single tree's tiny, careful adjustments, resulting in a prediction about the potential donor's likelihood of contributing. \n",

This is a substantial improvement over the Naive Predictor.  The optimized model improved upon the unoptimized model by about 3%.  For a supervised learner, this is a good F-score.

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
